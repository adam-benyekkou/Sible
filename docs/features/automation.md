# Automated Operations

Sible enables proactive infrastructure management through native scheduling and data lifecycle automation.

## Cron-Based Scheduling
A native job scheduler enables the automation of recurring maintenance tasks. SREs can define cron-based intervals for playbooks—such as daily database backups, periodic security patching, or infrastructure health checks—ensuring continuous operational compliance.

## Execution Retention Policies
To maintain optimal system performance and prevent database bloat, Sible includes automated data lifecycle management. Retention policies can be configured to prune historical execution logs and job data based on age or volume, ensuring the orchestration hub remains lightweight and responsive.

## Unified Notification Engine
Stay informed of execution outcomes through integrated Apprise support. Sible can send real-time alerts to over 100 services—including Slack, Discord, Telegram, and Microsoft Teams—triggered by job success or failure.
