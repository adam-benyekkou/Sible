# Philosophy

Sible is built on the 'Zero-Bloat' philosophy, designed for SREs and DevOps engineers who value speed, security, and operational transparency.

## Sovereign Infrastructure
The core mission of Sible is to provide a sovereign orchestration layer. It empowers organizations to manage their infrastructure without relying on heavy, opaque enterprise platforms.

## The Cavy-Protocol Mindset
Named after the robust and efficient Cavy, this protocol emphasizes:
- **Minimalism**: Only the essential features for reliable orchestration.
- **Speed**: Instantaneous feedback loops.
- **Security**: Hardened by default.
